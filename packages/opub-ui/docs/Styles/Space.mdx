# Space

Consistent spacing creates visual balance that makes the user interface (UI) easier for users to scan.
All of the space related styling can be done using `space` tokens. They range from `0px` to `128px`.
Border Radius and Width also rely on `space` tokens for their value. [Check out space tokens](/story/foundations-design-tokens--space)

Use space for `margins`, `paddings`, and `gaps` while developing to stay consistent with design.
