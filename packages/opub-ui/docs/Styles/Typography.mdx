# Typography

Typography plays a crucial role in defining hierarchy within design. Variable weights convey different levels of importance, where bolder weights indicate greater significance.

## Font

OPub relies on [Inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter), an open source variable font. This allows variation in font weight and slant.
In case the language does not support the font family, system fonts should be employed for compatibility.

### Indian Font

We are also experimenting if we can incorporate [Mukta](https://github.com/EkType/Mukta) for Indian languages. It's a mono-linear font family available in seven weights, supporting Devanagari, Gujarati, Gurumukhi, Tamil and Latin scripts

### Mono

While making any refernce to code, a mono font should be used. OPub relies on `Ubuntu Mono` for this.

## Type scale

A type scale is a selection of font styles that can be used across an app, ensuring a flexible, yet consistent, style that accommodates a range of purposes. OPub type scale is a combination of 22 styles, built using combination of font size, font weight, line height and line spacing.

The Type scales are divided in 2 categories, Heading and Body. Heading have different styles for smaller screen sizes.

You can head over to [Figma Kit](https://www.figma.com/file/c3qljmNHrwu3whdXIXYhQ1/D4D-Design-System?node-id=1:2&mode=dev) to know about all of the type scales.

To use them in code, use [Text component](/docs/components-text--docs)
